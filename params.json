{"name":"Geospatial Distribution Map","tagline":"Developed with python and R","body":"### Project Introduction\r\nI was in awe with the Facebook Global Social Network Map created by Paul Butler:\r\n\r\n![abcd](http://revolution-computing.typepad.com/.a/6a010534b1db25970b0147e0ae51b2970b-800wi)\r\n\r\nSo i thought of trying my hand in R and hence started this small experiment of mine with this image in my mind.\r\n\r\n***\r\n## Information Collection\r\nFacebook provides an awesome Graph API , that allows to get information regrding your friend's DOB,location,hometown,relationship status and many more.\r\nCheck out the graph API here: [Facebook Developers Tool](https://developers.facebook.com/tools-and-support/)\r\nI particularly used python to query the Graph API to get hold of location detail of my facebook friends.\r\n\r\nStart with importing all this necessary libraries\r\n```\r\nimport sys\r\nimport urllib\r\nimport urllib2\r\nimport time\r\nimport datetime\r\nimport json\r\nimport webbrowser\r\nimport csv\r\n```\r\n\r\nFacebook support OAuth authentication.To get access to the facebook Graph API ,authentication is required.\r\n\r\nwebbrowser.open(\"https://www.facebook.com/dialog/oauth?\"\r\n                    \"response_type=token&client_id=145634995501895&\"\r\n                    \"redirect_uri=http://developers.facebook.com/tools/\"\r\n                    \"explorer/callback&scope=user_birthday,user_friends,publish_actions\"\r\n                    \",read_stream\")\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
